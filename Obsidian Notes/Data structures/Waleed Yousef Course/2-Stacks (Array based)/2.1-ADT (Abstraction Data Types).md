**int MyArr[10] ;**

<u>Many things happened here:</u>

1-Reserving a contiguous space in memory, so that: memory size = element size * number of elements.
2-Giving the starting address the name **MyArr**.
3-If you write that **MyArr[3] = 27;** may things happened here also:
	3.1-Calculates the location address = **MyArr + (3 * sizeof(int))**
	3.2-Stores 27 in this location.

#### <u>Definition:</u>

A stack is a container of objects. These objects are inserted(pushed) and removed(popped) according to the principle of Last In First Out or as programmers would say LIFO. Stacks only allow the two operations push which adds an item and pop that removes the item. Stacks only work from the top down.
#### <u>Mechanism:</u>

#### <u>Why stack:</u>

We need stack data structures because they are useful in many different applications. Here are some of the reasons why we need stack data structures:
- **Undo and redo:** Stacks are used to implement undo and redo functionality in many applications. For example, a word processor uses a stack to store the changes that the user makes to a document. This allows the user to undo any changes that they make by popping them off the stack.
- **Function calls:** Stacks are used to implement function calls in many programming languages. When a function is called, its arguments and local variables are pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its arguments and local variables are popped off the stack.
- **Expression evaluation:** Stacks are used to evaluate expressions in many programming languages. For example, a stack can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions.
- **Parsing:** Stacks are used to parse sentences in many programming languages. For example, a stack can be used to parse arithmetic expressions.

Here are some additional examples of where stack data structures are used:
- **Web browsers:** Web browsers use a stack to store the history of visited websites. This allows the user to go back to a previous website by popping it off the stack.
- **Text editors:** Text editors use a stack to store the undo history. This allows the user to undo any changes that they make to a document by popping them off the stack.
- **Calculators:** Calculators use a stack to store the operands and operators of an expression. This allows the calculator to evaluate the expression correctly.
- **Compilers:** Compilers use a stack to parse the source code of a program. This allows the compiler to generate the machine code for the program correctly.

#### <u>Example in C language:</u>

void ReverseRead(void)
{

 //StackEntry should be defined as char
  StackEntry  item;
  
 // Create stack.
  Stack stack;
  
 //Initialize the stack to be empty
  InitStack(&stack);
  
  while (!StackFull(&stack) && (item = getchar()) != '\n')
  {
  
	//Push each item onto the stack
	Push(item, &stack);
	
  }

  while (!StackEmpty(&stack))
  {
  
	//Pop an item from the stack.
	 Pop(&item, &stack); 
	 
	   putchar(item);
	   
  }

  putchar('\n');

}

#### <u>Steps to create a stack:</u>

Stack of elements of type T is a finite sequence of elements of T together with the following operations:

1-Create the stack, leaving it empty.

2-Determine whether the stack is empty or not.

3-Determine whether the stack is full or not.

4-Find the size of the stack.

5-Push a new entry onto the top of the stack, provided the stack is not full.

6-Pop the entry off the top of the stack, provided the stack is not empty.

7-Retrieve the Top entry off the stack, provided the stack is not empty.

8-Traverse the stack, visiting each entry.

9-Clear the stack to make it empty.
